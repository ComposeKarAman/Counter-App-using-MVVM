## 🌟 **Key Concepts**  

### 🏗️ **MVVM Architecture**  
- **Model**: Manages the data and logic (e.g., the Counter state).  
- **View**: Handles the UI and user interaction (built with Jetpack Compose).  
- **ViewModel**: Connects the View and Model, handling business logic and exposing data for the UI.  

### 💡 **Jetpack Compose**  
- **Declarative UI toolkit** for building fast and responsive interfaces.
